# Ligea Alexander — Resume Site

A lightweight, fast, and legible resume site built for my application to the **Frontend Developer Internship at Kontinentalist**. I designed this to be simple, scannable, and respectful of a reviewer’s time—so you can get to the good stuff quickly.

**Live site:** https://ligea-alexander.github.io/resume-site/  
**Portfolio (WIP):** https://ligea-alexander.github.io/portfolio-2/

## Why this exists

I’m an **early-career interactive developer and data visualization analyst** who wants to work in **data journalism**. I love the point where reporting, design, and code meet to tell stories that stick.

**Highlights**
- I supported early interactive prototyping for a **Nikkei Business** feature (exploration phase; the final story shipped in a different direction).
- I created **Cost of Sunlight** to explore public space and exposure—an early attempt at turning curiosity into a narrative with data. I’m committed to leveling it up with stronger data sources and clearer framing.
- At CEO, I led **executive-facing dashboard narratives** and helped prototype **PathwayPal**, a lightweight AI assistant—work that sharpened my sense of clarity, hierarchy, and responsible interactivity.

This summer, under guidance from **Fernando Becerra**, I learned **D3.js foundations (vanilla)** and I’m continuing to advance—because I want to build interactive visuals that carry editorial weight, not just look good.

## How I build (and why this site looks the way it does)

I **vibe-coded** this resume site because speed + UX pragmatism matter. We live in a new time: iteration beats perfection, and the medium should serve the story.

**Design choices**
- **Functionality first.** Reduce cognitive load and friction wherever possible.
- **Scan-friendly layout.** Clear headings, compact sections, obvious actions.

## What I’ll do to improve

- Add more **“Case Snippets”** section linking to more interactive charts.  
- Tighten **a11y** (tab order, ARIA labels) and add a **high-contrast toggle**.  
- Add a an improved **printable layout** that exports cleanly to PDF from the page.

## About me

I’m motivated by clarity, narrative, and craft. My goal is to contribute to teams that blend **journalistic rigor** with **interactive design**—and to keep leveling up my **D3** and frontend skills so the medium elevates the reporting.

Thanks for reading, and for considering my application.
